# Clustering_Microbial-growth
 yeasts are important cell factories for the transition towards more sustainable industrial processes. Their physiological characterization in bioreactors generates large amounts of data that is manually analyzed by the scientists to find patterns and cluster the growth into different phases.  The development of improved tools for efficient and accurate data analysis is essential for bioprocesses.  We want to present a tool that can organize, cluster, and derive meaningful patterns from the physiological characterization of microbial cell factories.
